# Unit 02 CSS and Bootstrap Homework: Responsive Portfolio

This homework assignment required you to be able to identify the different web framework layouts that were required. Bootstrap is a fundamental tool to avoid adding too much external CSS into your webpages as it has pre-configured styles in their HTML semantic elements. The page is also mobile responsiveness so as to be compatible across all type of devices and still user friendly. 

The main 'About' page (i.e., index.html) has a navigation bar, a main content section with an image on the side, and it ends with a footer
* Given these main blocks of the page, we are able to decipher each segment of the page and break up the code to focus on each section at a time

The Portfolio page has the same base layout of a navigation bar, a main content section, and a footer at the bottom of the page.
* The backbone of this page will match the other web pages for uniformity and cohesiveness. 
* The Portfolio is broken up to display a 2x3 grid depicting each project, without a 6th project on the bottom right

The Contact page, like the other pages, has the same base framework (navbar, main section, footer)
* The key component on this page is the form section which requires the user to input information that gets recorded in the HTML


Overall, this homework assignment was a bit challenging as I struggled trying to match my webpages with the examples shown, but also I struggled in getting the margins and padding for proper alignments, but overall this was a really critical project to initialize a backbone to begin my own Portfolio page to link out to friends, colleagues, and potential new prospectives.
